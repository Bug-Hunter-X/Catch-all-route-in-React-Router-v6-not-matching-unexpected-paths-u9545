This bug report describes an issue with the catch-all route ('/*') in React Router v6.  The catch-all route is not correctly handling paths that it should. The provided code demonstrates a simple React Router setup. The expected behavior is that any unmatched path should render the NotFound component. However, the current implementation fails to do so for certain paths, unexpectedly rendering other components instead. This issue leads to broken links and an inconsistent user experience.
